Personal solutions for problems on rosalind.info, "a platform for learning **bioinformatics** and **programming** through problem solving" -- 2 fields in which I am very interested.

These solutions are mostly going to be written in Python, but can vary depending on what I find best for solving the problem.

I have included my solutions in this public repository for educational purposes as well as to demonstrate my growth in ability over time as a programmer. Please do not use any solutions found here to solve the problems online without doing it yourself -- it'll only spoil the fun and challenge!
